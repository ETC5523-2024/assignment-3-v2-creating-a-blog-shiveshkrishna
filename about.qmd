I’m currently pursuing a _Master of Business Analytics_ at _Monash University_, where I focus on developing expertise in _data analysis_, _machine learning_, and solving complex business challenges with _data-driven insights_.

I’m always looking for new opportunities to collaborate on projects that leverage _data_ to drive informed decision-making across various industries.

Recently, I worked on a project exploring how key performance metrics, such as _strike rates_ and _economy rates_, can be used to optimize _IPL auction strategies_, helping teams make _data-driven decisions_ for better performance.

This website is where I share my projects and learning experiences. Feel free to connect with me through the links provided at the top to discuss potential collaborations or simply talk data.
